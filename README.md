# DALi-Talk

"The spontaneous method of irrational understanding based upon the interpretative critical association of delirious phenomena." - Salvador Dali

DALi-Talk fancifully began as a daemon background process which works tirelessly to Scrape and Crawl the web. Tokenized, each sequence follows a classification based on the mathematical formalism of spin, torque, and normed volumes. The concept of A concurrent temporal synapse. 

DALi-Talk is a Stochastic Context-Free Grammar with an inherent ability to cache time, location, event and coordinates for web-queries filtered by intent - i.e:  "I need Coffee", "I'm Hungry". 

We have been inspired by the marriage of Stochastic Quantization in Physics with Markovian Ontologies in Artificial Intelligence.
